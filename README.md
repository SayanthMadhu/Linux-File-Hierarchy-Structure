Linux File Hierarchy Structure 
The Linux File Hierarchy Structure or the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems. It is maintained by the Linux Foundation. 

In the FHS, all files and directories appear under the root directory /, even if they are stored on different physical or virtual devices.
Some of these directories only exist on a particular system if certain subsystems, such as the X Window System, are installed.
Most of these directories exist in all UNIX operating systems and are generally used in much the same way; however, the descriptions here are those used specifically for the FHS and are not considered authoritative for platforms other than Linux.
